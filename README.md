# Hubspot Customer Lead Report Dashboard

1. Create your own .env file

2. insert HUBSPOT_API_KEY=# here and upload the source to vercel or another next.js host

3. That's it! pull your data in and give your bosses reports that hubspot cant give you!

4. Also to note: the dashboard is password protected. Under dashboard.tsx we set a front end password (not secure) which by default is: largeoilrig
